 + Added ability to capture not-yet-captured invoices for orders
 * Fixed an issue where SFTP connections failed (Error: "Could not connect to SFTP server [...]"). If SFTP connections still fail now, it's probably caused by an incompatible SFTP server or a firewall. This issue was most likely caused by Magento 2.3.x.

===== 2.7.2 =====

 * Logging improvements

===== 2.7.8 =====
 + Added further FTP compatibility feature: "Ignore IP returned by server in passive mode" - If enabled in the FTP source, the (local) IP address returned by the FTP server will be ignored (useful for servers behind NAT) and instead the servers public IP address will be used. Can help with "Operation now in progress" errors or other directory listing/transfer issues.

===== 2.7.9 =====
 + Added ability to force invoice/shipment increment_id for newly imported invoices/shipments. So you can set the invoice increment_id (the "invoice #") from a value from your file. If the invoice/shipment increment_id exists already, the order won't be shipped/invoiced as the increment_id must be unique.

===== 2.8.0 =====
 * Fixed a potential security issue: Reflected XSS via GET parameters in backend/manual import area. If "Add secret keys to URLs" is enabled in the backend (which should hopefully always be the case!) this should have been nearly impossible to exploit though.

===== 2.8.5 =====
 * Fixed an issue for tracking emails ("New Shipment") sent by the extension: For partial shipments, under certain circumstances the tracking numbers of previous partial shipments (of the same order, so no data leak) were contained in the email, which was confusing for customers.

===== 2.8.6 =====
 * Fixed issue "Property tracksCollection does not exist"

===== 2.8.7 =====
 + Added ability to create "offline" credit memos (i.e. no "online" refund via the payment gateway)
